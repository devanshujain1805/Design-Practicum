** Under the course IC201P Design Practicum **

This is the code for Visual and IR detection. 
There are three parts of the code
1) hand_detection.py :- It is the code for detecting hands through IR sensor only, basically when a person insert his hand into machine.
2) object_detection.py :- It is the code for detecting person using pi camera and openCV library of python.
