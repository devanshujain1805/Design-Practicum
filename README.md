** Under the course IC201P Design Practicum **
This is the code for Visual and IR detection. 
There are three parts of the code
1) hand_detection.py :- It is the code for detecting hands through IR sensor only, basically when a person insert his hand into machine.
2) object_detection.py :- It is the code for detecting person through pi camera and in-built machine learning model of cv2.
3) main.py :- It is the main file, where if both hand and objection detected the machine will start.
